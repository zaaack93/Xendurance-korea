11. IDEA SUBMISSIONS
</span><br><br>
We are pleased to hear from users and welcome your comments regarding Xendurance’s services and products. Nevertheless, our long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested (see below). While we value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or our affiliates' professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as show designs, photographs, drawings, or original artwork.

If you send or post certain specific submissions at our request (e.g., via message boards or in connection with contests) or if you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, photographs, drawings, concepts, or any other information (each, a "Submission" and collectively, the "Submissions") despite our request that you not send us any unsolicited Submissions or other creative materials, the Submission will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance.

None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of us, and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Any Submission may be used by us without restriction for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast or posting, and you hereby irrevocably waive, release and give up any claim that any use of such Submission violates any of your rights, subject to Section 16 of this Agreement, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights, publicity rights, or right to credit for the material or ideas. We shall have and are irrevocably granted the right, but not the obligation, to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, license, perform, post, sell, translate, incorporate, create derivative works from, distribute and otherwise use the Submission in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the universe, in perpetuity, without according you any compensation or credit.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that your relationship with us is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, subject to Section 16 of this Agreement, and that your decision to submit any material to us does not place us in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to your Submission. You understand and acknowledge that we have wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other literary materials, and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to us or being developed by our own employees. Many ideas or stories may be competitive with, similar or identical to your Submission in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects. You acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of our use of any such similar or identical material. Finally, you acknowledge that, with respect to any claim you may have relating to or arising out of an actual or alleged exploitation or use of any material you submit to the Site and/or us, the damage, if any, thereby caused will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle you to injunctive or other equitable relief or to in any way enjoin the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of any production based on or allegedly based on the material, and your rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law, subject to Section 16 of this Agreement.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
